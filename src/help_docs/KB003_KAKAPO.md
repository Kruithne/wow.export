# KB003: Oh no! The kākāpō has exploded!
In the event of most errors, wow.export will show a simple error message at the top of the screen and try to gracefully continue.

In the event that it cannot continue, you may be faced with the following screen, informing you the kākāpō has exploded.

![oh no](res/KB003_kakapo.png)

In this scenario, you'll need to restart wow.export and try again - however this should never happen, so if it does, you should report it to us immediately so we can work on a fix.

The best place to report these issues are through our [Discord](::DISCORD) or on our [GitHub issue tracker](::ISSUE_TRACKER).

## Okay, but what's a kākāpō?
A kākāpō is the world's only flightless parrot; they're native to New Zealand and are critically endangered.

Consider donating to [Kākāpō Recovery](https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/kakapo-recovery/get-involved/donate/) to help support the conservation of these finely blotched creatures.
